                                <strong>Yenagoa, Nigeria</strong> – This June, Aibakuro Warder was disappointed by the
                                size
                                of
                                the
                                yam and cassava
                                tubers
                                she harvested from her farms in Ikarama, a community in the southernmost Nigerian state
                                of
                                Bayelsa.
                                Most were tiny and
                                in some locations, there was no yield.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                “This is what we have been dealing with since oil spills started,” the 51-year-old
                                mother of
                                five
                                said. “It makes it
                                difficult for me to feed my family and train my children in school because that is the
                                only
                                thing I
                                do”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thirty years ago there were no spills, Warder recalls. Then she would go to the farm
                                with
                                her
                                mother
                                and grandmother.
                                The harvest was always bountiful, she said, sometimes up to 20 bags and sometimes more.
                                Yam tubers were huge and sometimes up to three feet (91 cm) tall, she said. And they
                                sold
                                every
                                farm
                                produce they took
                                to the market and bought whatever they wanted on their way back, she added.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now all of that has changed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                These days, Warder is forced to accept whatever amount buyers offer for her tubers at
                                the
                                market
                                because the produce is
                                tiny. And the proceeds are insufficient to buy basic items at the market for her
                                children or
                                cater
                                to their education.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                “It is better we don’t even cultivate because our crops die after planting and we must
                                replant
                                repeatedly,” she said.
                                “As we dig the soil, we find crude oil during planting,”. “Some species of cocoyam have
                                disappeared.”
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                She is not alone. Dominion Ibatou, 67 is yet to harvest anything from his farm in
                                Ikarama
                                because
                                the plants are
                                stunted. Washington Odoyibo, another farmer in the community, has waited for two years
                                for
                                his
                                plantain seeds to yield,
                                but they have not.

                                The Niger Delta region, home to more than 6.5 million people who depend on fishing and

                                has

                                But it also houses all of the deep oil and gas reserves that have accounted for more

                                And industry insiders say six 60 years of oil exploration have turned it into one of the
                                most
                                polluted places on earth and ruined among other things, farmlands.

                                In 2015, research published in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences by
                                scientists
                                from the Federal
                                University of Technology, Owerri in Imo – one of the states in the region – showed that
                                an
                                average
                                of 150 spills had
                                been recorded annually in the 60 years before.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2020 and 2021, Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA)
                                recorded a
                                combined total of
                                822
                                oil spills, resulting in 28,003 barrels spewing into the environment. Last December, a
                                month-long
                                spill in Nembe
                                community in Bayelsa led to youths protesting there and in the streets of the
                                capital Yenagoa.
                                These repeated spills and their effect on crop yields have led to a decline in local
                                food
                                production
                                and deepened poverty in communities in the Niger Delta.

                                “This has contributed to an increase in the price of food,” said Nnimmo Bassey, an

                            In Goi in neighbouring Rivers State, community leaders say crude oil seeps out of the
                            fermented cassava as it is
                            processed by local women making the staple meal of garri, rendering it unsafe for
                            consumption.
                            In 2021, a Dutch court ordered the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell to compensate four farmers
                            from Oruma in Ogbia in
                            Bayelsa who had instituted a case against the company for a 2008 oil spillage they say
                            affect their farms and yields.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One hotspot is Ikarama, a fishing and farming community in Bayelsa state, with an estimated
                            population of 50,000 people.
                            According to Morris Alagoa, Yenagoa-based head of field operations, Environmental Rights
                            Action/Friends of Earth Nigeria
                            (ERA/FoEN), it has the highest frequency of oil spill incidents in the state.
                            While there is no accurate data on the number of spills in the community, Alagoa says at
                            least 100 spills have been
                            recorded between 2007 and 2022.
                            Between June and December 2008 alone, five oil spills from Shell’s facility were recorded in
                            Ikarama. In 2011, at least
                            twelve oil spills and two fire outbreaks were reported in the community.
                            “Ikarama has lost its place as a food hub,”, Charles Oyibo, a lecturer at the department of
                            Geography and Environmental
                            Management at the Niger Delta University.
                            He said his unpublished research shows that most of the food items sold at the Ikarama
                            market, come from other
                            communities.

                        <p>
                            The oil companies operating there are Shell Petroleum Development Company [SPDC] and
                            Nigerian Agip Oil Company
                            [NAOC/Eni].
                            Alagoa alleges that most of these spills were from SPDC pipelines close to residential
                            buildings and farmlands. Other
                            spills have also occurred along Agip pipelines.
                            While SPDC claims that the spill sites in Ikarama have been cleaned and remediated in
                            accordance with industry
                            standards, civil society groups say they have documented testimonies from locals, with
                            indications to the contrary.
                            “We visited one of the locations where oil spills occurred in August 2021 and after we
                            cleared and dug a fresh spot, we
                            discovered crude oil at a depth of more than one metre (100cm), “Alagoa recalled.

                            Third-party interference
                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                Locals have linked most of the spills – including that of April 2021, when one of the
                                pipelines operated by the SPDC
                                discharged 213 barrels of crude oil into Ikarama – to equipment failure. But the company
                                often blames illegal
                                third-party interference (sabotage).
                                Locals say they have always wanted to protest for a proper clean-up but Ibatou claims
                                that
                                they are often intimidated by
                                the presence of security operatives in the community.
                                Oyibo told Al Jazeera that some locals are in cahoots with oil companies, hence the
                                continued spills and no efforts to
                                curb it.
                                “Until the community realises that their livelihoods depend on their lands, they will
                                continue to allow a few people to
                                benefit at their instance,” he said, adding that those with polluted farmlands are too
                                scared to protest.
                                And now, Warder and her peers say they are now considering trading options as an
                                alternative
                                source of livelihood. Some
                                of them now hew firewood from nearby bushes to sell.
                                “I have been looking for how to get soft loans from the government or any organisation
                                that
                                will be willing to help me
                                because I can’t go back to farming,” said Warder.

                                The blowout, at a non-producing well in the Santa Barbara field in Bayelsa state, has
                                caused extensive pollution of
                                rivers and farmland in the Nembe local government area, according to the state governor,
                                Douye Diri. According to the
                                News Agency of Nigeria, he said Aiteo should not think that “this criminal neglect of
                                its facilities and disregard for
                                human life and the environment, as demonstrated by its conduct, will not be accounted

                                immediately the well head is secure, the immediate and remote causes of the leak which

                                The oil industry in Nigeria attributes many oil spills to sabotage by people trying to
                                steal crude. Nigeria’s National
                                Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), which relies almost entirely on the
                                industry itself for access to on-
                                and offshore oil facilities, reports that around 75% of spills are caused by sabotage
                                and theft.

                                The joint team initially despatched to the Nembe spill was unable to determine the cause
                                of the spill, as the wellhead
                                could not be accessed “due to hydrocarbon fumes that saturated the atmosphere in the

                            Bayelsa is where oil was first discovered in Nigeria, in 1956. In the decades since, oil
                            spills from wells and pipelines
                            have contaminated farmland and water bodies, and exposed residents to toxic chemicals.
                            Flaring of gas has led to acid
                            rain falling on the area, while contributing to making Nigeria the 17th largest producer of
                            greenhouse gas emissions in
                            the world. This environmental destruction has been caused by oil majors including Shell,
                            Chevron and
                            Eni. The Nembe well was bought
                            from Shell by Lagos-based Aiteo in 2015.

                            But getting oil firms to clean up or pay for environmental crimes in Nigeria is difficult.
                            Legal claims for compensation
                            can take years, even decades, and companies are expected to pay relatively little in fines

                            NOSDRA’S regulations say oil companies have 24 hours to respond to the discovery of a spill.
                            A joint visit by government
                            agencies, company officials and community representatives should take place as soon as
                            possible. But a 2018 study by
                            Amnesty International found frequent delays, with some spills continuing for months after
                            they were reported.

                            Shell, one of the largest operators in the country, visited spill sites within 24 hours on
                            just 26% of occasions,
                            Amnesty said. The slowest response time recorded was when Eni took 430 days to respond to a
                            spill in Bayelsa state.
                            “These delays point to serious negligence. Shell and Eni are wealthy, powerful
                            multinationals: why can’t they act
                            faster? Why can’t they do more?,” the report said.

                            Speaking to the ongoing spill at Nembe, HOMEF’s Bassey said that considering the apparent
                            scale and duration of the
                            latest spill, the safest option for residents of the area is to be relocated. “This area
                            does not have pipe-borne water,
                            and when the river is covered with crude oil, it means they have to depend on imported
                            water,” he said. “Some may drink
                            from that river because these areas are permanently polluted and they have no option.
                            Children will swim in that river
                            and people will drink from that river.”

                            “Crude oil contains very toxic heavy metals like lead; you know, lead affects a lot things

                                Ogoniland, and set out urgent recommendations for clean-up. But the new investigation
                                highlights that “emergency
                                measures” proposed by UNEP have not been properly implemented and that the

                                HYPREP, and the Nigerian government.
                                While oil companies like Shell spend millions greenwashing their image, tens of
                                thousands of people continue to suffer
                                from their pollution and negligence <br>

                                This year, Shell is facing a series of European court battles over its business in
                                Nigeria. On 23 June, the UK’s Supreme
                                Court will hear an appeal brought by two Niger Delta communities, Ogale and Bille. They
                                claim that over several years
                                they have suffered systematic and ongoing oil pollution because of Shell’s operations.
                                The court will decide whether it
                                can proceed on the critical issue of whether Royal Dutch Shell (UK and Netherlands
                                headquartered) is liable for the
                                actions of its Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).

                                Godwin Ojo, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria said: “After nine
                                years of promises without proper
                                action and decades of pollution, the people of Ogoniland are not only sick of dirty
                                drinking water, oil-contaminated
                                fish and toxic fumes. They are sick of waiting for justice, they are dying by the day.
                                The Nigerian government should
                                acknowledge this project has been a failure and reinvigorate HYPREP with technical
                                skills and strategic thinking, fully
                                involving the community.”
                                Shell must not get away with this – we will continue to fight until every last trace of
                                oil is removed from Ogoniland. <br>

                                Colin Roche, Friends of the Earth Europe said: “Nine years on, there is still no
                                clean-up, no ‘emergency’ health and
                                water measures, no transparency and no accountability. Without urgent action there will
                                be no justice. While oil
                                companies like Shell spend millions greenwashing their image, tens of thousands of
                                people continue to suffer from their
                                pollution and negligence. European governments like the UK, the Netherlands, France and
                                Italy must act to support a
                                truly effective clean-up and ensure these companies are held accountable for the
                                devastating pollution of the Niger
                                Delta.”

                                brought huge suffering for its
                                people. Over many years we have documented how Shell has failed to clean up
                                contamination from spills and it’s a scandal
                                that this has not yet happened. The pollution is leading to serious human rights impacts
                                – on people’s health and
                                ability to access food and clean water. Shell must not get away with this – we will
                                continue to fight until every last
                                trace of oil is removed from Ogoniland.”

                                Work has begun on only 11% of polluted sites identified by UNEP, with only a further 5%
                                included in current clean-up
                                efforts, and no site has been entirely cleaned up;

                                Actions classified by UNEP as “emergency measures” – immediate action on drinking water
                                and health protection – have not
                                been implemented properly; there are still communities without access to clean water
                                supplies; • Health and

                                There has not been any public accounting for how the 31 million USD funding provided
                                since 2018 has been spent;

                                11 of 16 companies contracted for the clean-up are reported to have no registered

                                or related areas; HYPREP has numerous conflicts of interest as Shell continues to be
                                involved in the governing boards for the clean-up and
                                even places its own staff in HYPREP.
