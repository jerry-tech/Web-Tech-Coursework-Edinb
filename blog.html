                            <strong>Yenagoa, Nigeria</strong> – This June, Aibakuro Warder was disappointed by the size
                            of
                            the
                            yam and cassava
                            tubers
                            she harvested from her farms in Ikarama, a community in the southernmost Nigerian state of
                            Bayelsa.
                            Most were tiny and
                            in some locations, there was no yield.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “This is what we have been dealing with since oil spills started,” the 51-year-old mother of
                            five
                            said. “It makes it
                            difficult for me to feed my family and train my children in school because that is the only
                            thing I
                            do”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thirty years ago there were no spills, Warder recalls. Then she would go to the farm with
                            her
                            mother
                            and grandmother.
                            The harvest was always bountiful, she said, sometimes up to 20 bags and sometimes more.
                            Yam tubers were huge and sometimes up to three feet (91 cm) tall, she said. And they sold
                            every
                            farm
                            produce they took
                            to the market and bought whatever they wanted on their way back, she added.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now all of that has changed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These days, Warder is forced to accept whatever amount buyers offer for her tubers at the
                            market
                            because the produce is
                            tiny. And the proceeds are insufficient to buy basic items at the market for her children or
                            cater
                            to their education.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            “It is better we don’t even cultivate because our crops die after planting and we must
                            replant
                            repeatedly,” she said.
                            “As we dig the soil, we find crude oil during planting,”. “Some species of cocoyam have
                            disappeared.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She is not alone. Dominion Ibatou, 67 is yet to harvest anything from his farm in Ikarama
                            because
                            the plants are
                            stunted. Washington Odoyibo, another farmer in the community, has waited for two years for
                            his
                            plantain seeds to yield,
                            but they have not.

                            The Niger Delta region, home to more than 6.5 million people who depend on fishing and
                            farming,
                            has

                            But it also houses all of the deep oil and gas reserves that have accounted for more than 70
                            percent
                            of Nigeria’s foreign revenue since the 1970s.

                        <p>
                            And industry insiders say six 60 years of oil exploration have turned it into one of the
                            most
                            polluted places on earth and ruined among other things, farmlands.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2015, research published in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences by
                            scientists
                            from the Federal
                            University of Technology, Owerri in Imo – one of the states in the region – showed that an
                            average
                            of 150 spills had
                            been recorded annually in the 60 years before.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 2020 and 2021, Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA)
                            recorded a
                            combined total of
                            822
                            oil spills, resulting in 28,003 barrels spewing into the environment. Last December, a
                            month-long
                            spill in Nembe
                            community in Bayelsa led to youths protesting there and in the streets of the
                            capital Yenagoa.
                            These repeated spills and their effect on crop yields have led to a decline in local food
                            production
                            and deepened poverty in communities in the Niger Delta.

                            environmental
                            rights activist and
                            director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF). “Quality of food consumed has

                            In Goi in neighbouring Rivers State, community leaders say crude oil seeps out of the
                            fermented cassava as it is
                            processed by local women making the staple meal of garri, rendering it unsafe for
                            consumption.
                            In 2021, a Dutch court ordered the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell to compensate four farmers
                            from Oruma in Ogbia in
                            Bayelsa who had instituted a case against the company for a 2008 oil spillage they say
                            affect their farms and yields.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One hotspot is Ikarama, a fishing and farming community in Bayelsa state, with an estimated
                            population of 50,000 people.
                            According to Morris Alagoa, Yenagoa-based head of field operations, Environmental Rights
                            Action/Friends of Earth Nigeria
                            (ERA/FoEN), it has the highest frequency of oil spill incidents in the state.
                            While there is no accurate data on the number of spills in the community, Alagoa says at
                            least 100 spills have been
                            recorded between 2007 and 2022.
                            Between June and December 2008 alone, five oil spills from Shell’s facility were recorded in
                            Ikarama. In 2011, at least
                            twelve oil spills and two fire outbreaks were reported in the community.
                            “Ikarama has lost its place as a food hub,”, Charles Oyibo, a lecturer at the department of
                            Geography and Environmental
                            Management at the Niger Delta University.
                            He said his unpublished research shows that most of the food items sold at the Ikarama
                            market, come from other
                            communities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The oil companies operating there are Shell Petroleum Development Company [SPDC] and
                            Nigerian Agip Oil Company
                            [NAOC/Eni].
                            Alagoa alleges that most of these spills were from SPDC pipelines close to residential
                            buildings and farmlands. Other
                            spills have also occurred along Agip pipelines.
                            While SPDC claims that the spill sites in Ikarama have been cleaned and remediated in
                            accordance with industry
                            standards, civil society groups say they have documented testimonies from locals, with
                            indications to the contrary.
                            “We visited one of the locations where oil spills occurred in August 2021 and after we
                            cleared and dug a fresh spot, we
                            discovered crude oil at a depth of more than one metre (100cm), “Alagoa recalled.

                        </p>

                        <h5>
                            Third-party interference
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Locals have linked most of the spills – including that of April 2021, when one of the
                            pipelines operated by the SPDC
                            discharged 213 barrels of crude oil into Ikarama – to equipment failure. But the company
                            often blames illegal
                            third-party interference (sabotage).
                            Locals say they have always wanted to protest for a proper clean-up but Ibatou claims that
                            they are often intimidated by
                            the presence of security operatives in the community.
                            Oyibo told Al Jazeera that some locals are in cahoots with oil companies, hence the
                            continued spills and no efforts to
                            curb it.
                            “Until the community realises that their livelihoods depend on their lands, they will
                            continue to allow a few people to
                            benefit at their instance,” he said, adding that those with polluted farmlands are too
                            scared to protest.
                            And now, Warder and her peers say they are now considering trading options as an alternative
                            source of livelihood. Some
                            of them now hew firewood from nearby bushes to sell.
                            “I have been looking for how to get soft loans from the government or any organisation that
                            will be willing to help me
                            because I can’t go back to farming,” said Warder.

                        <strong>Yenagoa, Nigeria</strong> – This June, Aibakuro Warder was disappointed by the size of
                        the
                        yam and cassava
                        tubers
                        she harvested from her farms in Ikarama, a community in the southernmost Nigerian state of
                        Bayelsa.
                        Most were tiny and
                        in some locations, there was no yield.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “This is what we have been dealing with since oil spills started,” the 51-year-old mother of
                        five
                        said. “It makes it
                        difficult for me to feed my family and train my children in school because that is the only
                        thing I do”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thirty years ago there were no spills, Warder recalls. Then she would go to the farm with her
                        mother and grandmother.
                        The harvest was always bountiful, she said, sometimes up to 20 bags and sometimes more.
                        Yam tubers were huge and sometimes up to three feet (91 cm) tall, she said. And they sold every
                        farm
                        produce they took
                        to the market and bought whatever they wanted on their way back, she added.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now all of that has changed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These days, Warder is forced to accept whatever amount buyers offer for her tubers at the market
                        because the produce is
                        tiny. And the proceeds are insufficient to buy basic items at the market for her children or
                        cater
                        to their education.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “It is better we don’t even cultivate because our crops die after planting and we must replant
                        repeatedly,” she said.
                        “As we dig the soil, we find crude oil during planting,”. “Some species of cocoyam have
                        disappeared.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She is not alone. Dominion Ibatou, 67 is yet to harvest anything from his farm in Ikarama
                        because
                        the plants are
                        stunted. Washington Odoyibo, another farmer in the community, has waited for two years for his
                        plantain seeds to yield,
                        but they have not.

                        The Niger Delta region, home to more than 6.5 million people who depend on fishing and farming,
                        has
                        all-year-round
                        agricultural production activities by virtue of being in the country’s rainforest and mangrove
                        forest vegetative zones
                        of Nigeria.
                        But it also houses all of the deep oil and gas reserves that have accounted for more than 70
                        percent
                        of Nigeria’s foreign revenue since the 1970s.

                    <p>
                        And industry insiders say six 60 years of oil exploration have turned it into one of the most
                        polluted places on earth and ruined among other things, farmlands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2015, research published in the International Journal of Environmental Sciences by scientists
                        from the Federal
                        University of Technology, Owerri in Imo – one of the states in the region – showed that an
                        average
                        of 150 spills had
                        been recorded annually in the 60 years before.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2020 and 2021, Nigeria’s National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) recorded a
                        combined total of
                        822
                        oil spills, resulting in 28,003 barrels spewing into the environment. Last December, a
                        month-long
                        spill in Nembe
                        community in Bayelsa led to youths protesting there and in the streets of the
                        capital Yenagoa.
                        These repeated spills and their effect on crop yields have led to a decline in local food
                        production
                        and deepened poverty in communities in the Niger Delta.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “This has contributed to an increase in the price of food,” said Nnimmo Bassey, an environmental
                        rights activist and
                        director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF). “Quality of food consumed has also
                        been
                        affected”.
